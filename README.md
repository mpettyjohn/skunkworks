# Skunkworks

In a perfect world I'd spend 0% of my time on tooling, developer environments or any of that shit, but these are exciting times where the frontier is moving every day and it's often some random on twitter with the latest, greatest idea. Lots of noise, but plenty of signal.

This project is the culmination of finally getting Claude Code and not wanting to get so far behind the curve as to be unable to catch up.
I like or bookmark CC or agentic coding ideas. Then have Claude scrape them once in awhile, see if there's any category of feature I want to add to this, do so, then move on. It's not 0% of my time, but it's simple enough.

Right now I know a big missing feature is Design. 

I've also seen tons of Ralph hype, but haven't done any work to understand it yet. If Ralph's still a thing in February maybe that will get a look.

If there are other features you think this would be worth having, let me know, or add them in yourself.

The rest of this README is AI generated by Claude Code. And for the love of Kelly Johnson build something better than a todo app.

Skunkworks chains together multiple AI models to build software for you. Each AI is picked for what it's best at, and they check each other's work.

```
You: "I want to build a task tracker for my team"
     ↓
Skunkworks interviews you, designs it, builds it, and reviews it
     ↓
You: Working software with professional UI
```

## Why Multiple AIs?

Different AI models have different blind spots. If you use the same AI to build and review, it won't catch its own mistakes.

| Phase | Model | Why This Model |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **Interview** | Claude Opus 4.5 | Best at understanding intent and asking good questions |
| **Architect** | GPT-5.2-Codex | Strongest at system design and planning |
| **Council** | Codex + Gemini | Multiple perspectives catch more issues |
| **Builder** | Claude Opus 4.5 | Top coding benchmark scores |
| **Reviewer** | Gemini 3 Flash | Fresh eyes, different blind spots |

## Installation

### Prerequisites

You need these AI CLI tools (uses your existing subscriptions - no API keys):

```bash
# Claude Code CLI (requires Claude Max subscription)
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# OpenAI Codex CLI (requires ChatGPT Pro subscription)
npm install -g @openai/codex

# Gemini CLI (requires Google account)
npm install -g @google/gemini-cli
```

### Install Skunkworks

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/mpettyjohn/skunkworks.git
cd skunkworks

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build
npm run build

# Link globally
npm link
```

Verify installation:
```bash
skunk models
```

## Quick Start

### Start a New Project

```bash
skunk new "I want to build a todo app for my team"
```

Skunkworks will:
1. **Interview you** about what you need (no technical questions)
2. **Design the architecture** and create a plan
3. **Get the plan reviewed** by multiple AIs
4. **Build the software** following the plan
5. **Run tests and visual checks**
6. **Review the code** for bugs and issues

### Continue Where You Left Off

```bash
skunk continue
```

### Check Status

```bash
skunk status
```

## The Pipeline

```
You describe your idea
        ↓
   Interview Phase (Claude asks clarifying questions)
        ↓
   Creates SPEC.md (what you want)
        ↓
   Council reviews the spec (Codex + Gemini check for gaps)
        ↓
   Architect Phase (Codex designs the system)
        ↓
   Creates ARCHITECTURE.md + DESIGN_SPEC.yaml
        ↓
   Council reviews the architecture (catches blind spots)
        ↓
   Builder Phase (Claude writes the code in phases)
        ↓
   Verification after each phase (tests + visual + accessibility)
        ↓
   Reviewer Phase (Gemini reviews everything)
        ↓
   Creates REVIEW.md (what's good, what needs work)
        ↓
   Learnings captured for future projects
```

## Features

### Design System Integration

AI-generated UIs often look inconsistent. Skunkworks fixes this with a built-in design system.

During interview, you answer simple questions:
- "Will people use this on phones or computers?"
- "Should it feel professional or casual?"
- "Do you have brand colors?"

These become strict design rules the Builder follows. Result: consistent, accessible UI.

### Cross-Project Learning

Skunkworks remembers solutions across projects. Fix a bug once, never solve it again.

```bash
# Capture learnings from current project
skunk compound

# Browse all learnings
skunk learnings
```

When you start a new project, relevant learnings appear automatically.

### Context Compression

Long projects can degrade AI quality. Skunkworks compresses context intelligently so each phase gets only what it needs.

```bash
# Check context health
skunk context-health
```

### Design & Accessibility Verification

Every build gets checked by [/rams](https://www.rams.ai/) for:
- WCAG 2.1 accessibility compliance
- Visual design consistency
- Missing component states
- Contrast and spacing issues

No more "AI slop" with random colors and inaccessible markup.

### Mission Control Dashboard

Track all your Skunkworks projects in one place:

```bash
# CLI dashboard - quick status overview
skunk dashboard

# Web dashboard - opens in browser
skunk dashboard --web

# Find existing projects
skunk dashboard --scan ~/Projects
```

Shows status for each project:
- **BLOCKED** - Waiting for your answer
- **NEEDS YOU** - Ready for input
- **RUNNING** - Building in progress
- **COMPLETE** - Done

The web dashboard auto-refreshes and lets you view project artifacts (SPEC.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, REVIEW.md).

### GitHub Integration

Track progress visually with GitHub Projects:

```bash
skunk github init
```

### Project Management

Manage multiple projects easily:

```bash
# List all your projects
skunk projects

# Open a project by number or name
skunk open 1
skunk open "recipe app"

# Rename a project
skunk rename 1 "Better Name"
```

### Smart Verification

Tests are selected based on what you're building:

| Project Type | What Gets Run |
|-------------|---------------|
| Web/JavaScript | `npm test` |
| iPhone app | Xcode tests |
| Android app | Gradle tests |
| Python backend | pytest |
| Go backend | go test |
| Rust | cargo test |

### Built for Non-Technical Users

Skunkworks protects you from technical complexity:

- **Interview phase won't build code** - Even if you say "build it," it creates a spec first
- **Architect won't ask technical questions** - No "React or Vue?" or "SwiftUI or UIKit?" - it decides
- **Platform compatibility checks** - Warns you if you can't build iOS apps on Windows
- **Council Synthesizer** - When AIs disagree, the Architect resolves conflicts so you don't have to
- **CLI health checks** - Detects auth issues before starting, not mid-build
- **Rate limit handling** - Pauses gracefully instead of crashing when hitting API limits

## FAQ

**Do I need to know how to code?**
No. Skunkworks handles the technical decisions.

**What if I don't like what it builds?**
You can ask for changes at any point. The interview phase understands what you want before building.

**Can I use it for existing projects?**
Yes. Run `skunk design init` to add the design system, or `skunk build` to work on existing code.

**What if one of the AI services is down?**
Skunkworks tells you which tool isn't available. Run again later.

**How much does it cost?**
Skunkworks is free. You pay for your existing AI subscriptions.

## Inspired By

Skunkworks stands on the shoulders of these ideas and projects:

- **[GSD (Get Shit Done)](https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done)** by glittercowboy — The context compression and "fresh subagent contexts" approach. GSD's insight: "Context stays fresh. Quality stays high."

- **Multi-model "Council" review** — [@tenobrus](https://x.com/tenobrus/status/2010428123310129487) on why same model = same blind spots, and [Andrej Karpathy's LLM Council](https://github.com/karpathy/llm-council) for the implementation. Having models critique each other catches errors a single model would miss.

- **[Thariq Shihipar](https://x.com/trq212/status/2005315275026260309)** — The spec-based development pattern using AskUserQuestion. "Start with a minimal spec and ask Claude to interview you... then make a new session to execute the spec."

- **[/rams](https://www.rams.ai/)** — Design and accessibility verification. Catches WCAG issues, visual inconsistencies, and missing component states.

- **Compounding Engineering** — [Kieran Klaassen](https://x.com/kieranklaassen/status/1976399877098831997) on cross-project learning, via [Flavio Copes](https://x.com/flaviocopes/status/2013281081735118889) who put it on our radar.
